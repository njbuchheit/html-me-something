                <h1>Mountain-side Wisdom</h1>

                <p>Four days after my wife and I were married, we almost died on the side of a mountain.<br>
                    We weren't planning on anything like this happening, then again we weren't really planning<br>
                    from the get go.<br>
                    Many valuable lessons were learned hiking that day, and hopefully the following lessons<br>
                    learned will be wisdom for others.
                </p>

                        <h3>Lesson 1 &#8209; Hike early</h3>
                        <p>Amy and I woke up late.  We slept in, ate a hardy breakfast, and took our time.<br>
                            This was unwise.<br>
                            Pike's Peak is over 14,000 feet tall.  Departing the Devil's Playground trailhead<br>
                            (already at an elevation of 9,000 feet) at 11:00am, we didn't make Devil's Playground<br>
                            until 3 hours later...We still had 3 hours to the summit.  We decided to turn around<br>
                            so as to make it back before dark.<br>
                            This was wise.</p>

                        <h3>Lesson 2 &#8209; Dress appropriately</h3>
                        <p>A Missouri native, I vastly underestimated Colorado's climate in October.<br>
                            At 9,000 feet, it was a typicaly autumn day.  Tons of trees, sturdy ground, and fresh<br>
                            breeze.  Pants, athletic shoes, thermal underwear, and a hoodie seemed to do the trick.<br>
                            At 13,000 feet, the mountain is a terrifying snowy moon-scape.<br>
                            I can't adequately stress the contrast.<br>
                            Above treeline, the snow piled up to four feet deep.  Traversing a rock-field, (we weren't<br>
                            aware there was rock until my foot sank into a white void, almost snapping my ankle) I<br>
                            realized more robust clothing was needed.  And by "more robust", I mean snow leopard hide.</p>

                        <h3>Lesson 3 &#8209; Think about wildlife defense</h3>
                        <p>I wasn't even thinking about bears.  At least, not until we saw bear tracks.<br>
                            I had no firearm, no hatchet, no bear spray (the term itself sounds insane), no knife,<br>
                            no scythe.<br>
                            All i had were my bear hands (zing!), and my wits (which were already on the fritz...see<br>
                            Lessons 1 and 2 above).<br>
                            Men, it's your duty to protect your wife.  Think about bears when doing so.</p>

                            We ended up not coming across any wildlife of bear size, however, it's very possible we<br>
                            could have.<br>
                            Men, it's your duty to protect your wife.  Think about bears, wolves, and lions when doing so.</p>
