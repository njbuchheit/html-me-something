                <h1>Mountain Wisdom</h1>
                <img src=""/>

                <p>Four days after my wife and I were married, we almost died on the side of a mountain.<br>
                    We weren't planning on anything like this happening, then again we weren't really planning<br>
                    from the get go.<br>
                    Many valuable lessons were learned hiking that day, and hopefully the following lessons<br>
                    learned will be wisdom for others.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Lesson 1 &#8209; Hike early</h3>
                        <p>Amy and I woke up late.  We slept in, ate a hardy breakfast, and took our time.<br>
                            This was unwise.<br>
                            Pike's Peak is over 14,000 feet tall.  Departing the Devil's Playground trailhead<br>
                            (already at an elevation of 9,000 feet) at 11:00am, we didn't make Devil's Playground<br>
                            until 3 hours later...We still had 3 hours to the summit.  We decided to turn around<br>
                            so as to make it back before dark.<br>
                            This was wise.</p>
                            </li>

                        <h3>Lesson 2 &#8209; Dress appropriately</h3>
                        <p>A Missouri native, I vastly underestimated Colorado's climate in October.<br>
                            At 9,000 feet, it was a typicaly autumn day.  Tons of trees, sturdy ground, and fresh<br>
                            breeze.  Pants, athletic shoes, thermal underwear, and a hoodie seemed to do the trick.<br>
                            At 13,000 feet, the mountain is a terrifying snowy moon-scape.<br>
                            I can't adequately stress the contrast.<br>
                            Above treeline, the snow piled up to four feet deep.  Traversing a rock-field, (we weren't<br>
                            aware there was rock until my foot sank into a white void, almost snapping my ankle) I<br>
                            realized more robust clothing was needed.  And by "more robust", I mean snow leopard hide.</p>
                            </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Lesson 3 &#8209; Think about wildlife defense</h3>
                        <p>I wasn't even thinking about bears.  At least, not until we saw bear tracks.<br>
                            I had no firearm, no hatchet, no bear spray (the term itself sounds insane), no knife,<br>
                            no scythe.<br>
                            All i had were my bear hands (zing!), and my wits (which were already on the fritz...see<br>
                            Lessons 1 and 2 above).<br>
                            Men, it's your duty to protect your wife.  Think about bears when planning to hike with her.</p>
                        </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3>Lesson 4 &#8209; Know how to get back</h3>
                        <p>At 2pm, having ascended to Devil's Playground, we decided to throw in the towel and call it<br>
                            quits...the summit wouldn't be made this day. That's when some very visceral terror set in.<br>
                            Turning around and following our footprints across a sea of white, we came upon a crest which<br>
                            framed our vantage point for the way down the monolith.  Up to this point, we'd been following<br>
                            another hiker's footprints.  Amy and I had not seen this hiker all day, but we found our way up<br>
                            the mountain side using their path.  These footprints (and ours) were now gone.  <em>Vanished.</em><br>
                            <em>"Finito"</em> as our Italian compadres say.<br>
                            We peered down and saw only miles of treeline a long, frigid distance away.<br>
                            The trail back was gone, hidden beneath the quiet whiteness that had once before been so beautiful.<br>
                            Our hearts had become like our limbs, frozen, bloodless, and numb.  We had no idea which iota of<br>
                            treeline to head for.  Amy and I started bustling down, half-way panicking, and for 20 minutes prayed<br>
                            Jesus would help us.  I spotted some craigs to our right that looked familiar and we headed towards<br>
                            them.  After trudging back across the snow-covered rock-field I mentioned earlier, we noticed a<br>
                            thin, band of darkness 200 yards away.  It was the trail.  Our hope landed.  We frantically bounded<br>
                            towards it and began our swift, knee-pounding, 2 hour descent.<br>
                            <b>ALWAYS BE AWARE WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND HOW TO GET BACK.</b>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <p>We eventually got home around 5 and enjoyed a hot meal.  Our trip could have easily ended with newspaper<br>
                    headlines proclaiming "Newly-weds Dissapear in Colorado" or "Missouri Dolt Leads Wife to Her Death".<br>
                    However, me made it back safely and now have knowledge and wisdom to share with others.<br>
                    Heed our advice.  Plan well, stay aware, start early, fight bears.<br></p>
