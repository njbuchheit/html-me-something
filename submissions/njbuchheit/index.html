        <h1>Mountain-side Wisdom</h1>

        <p>Four days after my wife and I were married, we almost died on the side of a mountain.
            We weren't planning on anything like this happening, then again we weren't really planning from the get go.
            Many valuable lessons were learned hiking that day, and hopefully the following lessons learned will be wisdom for others.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Lesson 1 - Hike early</h3>
                <p>Amy and I woke up late.  We slept in, ate a hardy breakfast, and took our time.<br>
                    This was unwise.<br>
                    Pike's Peak is over 14,000 feet tall.  Departing the Devil's Playground trailhead<br>
                    (already at an elevation of 9,000 feet) at 11:00am, we didn't make Devil's Playground<br>
                    until 3 hours later...We still had 3 hours to the summit.  We decided to turn around<br>
                    so as to make it back before dark.<br>
                    This was wise.<br>
                    </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Lesson 2 - Dress appropriately</h3>
                <p>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
